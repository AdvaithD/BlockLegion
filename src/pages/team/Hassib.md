I am Hassib Ashouri. A Software Engineering Spartan in my senior year. I am constantly looking to expand my knowledge of Blockchain, and eager to spread that knowledge. I enjoy doing many activities, so, in my free time, I like to get a constant dose of the following: soccer, weight lifting, reading books and news, trying new food and coffee places, and connecting with people. My motto in life is “Find a way or make one.”
